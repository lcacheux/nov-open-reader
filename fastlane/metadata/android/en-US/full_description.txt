Nov Open Reader is a small application to read data from NFC insulin pens from Novo Nordisk : NovoPen 6 and NovoPen Echo Plus.

Put the pen on the NFC reader of your phone to start retrieving its data, which will be simply displayed as a list. Doses within a one minute delay will be grouped as one, and first purging dose (2 units or less) will be hidden. Click on a grouped dose to display the details.
